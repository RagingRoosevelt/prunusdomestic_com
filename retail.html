        <h1>Retail Partnership</h1>
        <section>
          <p>Hi!  If you're responsible for merchandising at a fiber arts or fiber
          arts-adjacent shop in the Portland metro area and would like to sell 
          one of the designs I make, feel free to drop me an email: 
          <a href="mailto:partnership@PrunusDomestic.com">partnership@PrunusDomestic.com</a>
          </p>

          <p>Prunus Domestic is a relatively small operation and I'm scaling 
            organically as demand develops.  Right now, I'm handling sales on a
            "consignment" basis.  I'll provide inventory and if any sells, you can
            pay me the wholesale rate for that inventory.  I'll take back any 
            inventory you don't want to keep in stock. 
          </p>

          <p>If you'd like to arrange a more traditional inventory purchasing
            situation, I'm happy to discuss that but I'll need to make logistical
            arrangements on my end to make that happen.
          </p>

          <h2>Customizations</h2>
          I can accommodate customizations if you'd like to place a bulk order 
          for product.  Depending on the product, this might mean using graphics
          or a logo of your choice.  Or this could mean an exclusive design that
          we collaborate on.

          <h2>Product Development</h2>
          I'm interested in working with enthusiast fiber arts shops to develop 
          new products.  If you'd like help bringing a product to market, I'd 
          love to help you design / engineer it.  My focus is on 3D printed 
          products so if it seems like we're looking at an idea that wouldn't be
          suited to what I can do, I will be upfront about that.
